Who has not struggle doing linear algebra back and forth between R, Python and Matlab? They all have their own syntax and it can be confusing.

Here is a collection of cheat-sheets for common algebraic operations (matrix manipulation, vector operations, etc.) in R, Matlab, Numpy (Python), Mathjs (JavaScript) and Breeze (Scala). Please post an issue if you wish to support a new language / library.

This repository was inspired by Breeze's [Linear Algebra Cheat-Sheet](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Linear-Algebra-Cheat-Sheet).
